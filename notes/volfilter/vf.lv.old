# Volatility 

## Implied Volatility 

Consider a European call option with strike $K$ and expiry $T$ on an 
underlying whose risk neutral dynamics are described by
\eq{ dS/S = r dt + \sigma dB. }
The Black-Scholes price of this option c_t(K,T) at time $t$ is given by
\eq{ c_t(K,T) = exp(-r\tau) \mb{E}\left[ (S_T-K)^+ \right] }
where $\tau=T-t$.  All data needed to compute this price is agreed on
and publically available, with the exception of $\sigma$, the volatility
of the underlying asset.  As such all options are parameterised by
$\sigma$ - the only piece of the Black-Scholes pricing setup upon which
traders may disagree.  It can be shown that price $c_t$ is a monotonic 
(increasing) function of $\sigma$ so that Black-Scholes options can be 
quoted interchangeably either as a price or as a volatility.  Given an
observed price $\widehat{c}_t(K,T)$ in the market, there is a unique 
volatility $\sigma=\Sigma$ which produces the observed price when inserted
in the above Black-Scholes pricing formula.  This volaility $\Sigma$ is
the *implied volatility*.

Generally we have a grid of prices for each set of strikes and expiries.
By the above logic all option these options are parameterised by the same
underlying volatility $\sigma$.  But why then do we observe different
implied volatilities across the grid?  Typically we interpret this as a 
mix of supply/demand issues (eg large fund managers who are net long 
equities may be willing to pay a premium - a higher implied volatility
than expected - to buy some insurance against large equity price falls),
or psychological factors like weighting the impact of losses more than 
gains.  However, there may be something more that can be said here.

## Local Volatility

Assume that in reality the underlying evolves according to a more complex
diffusion process
\eq{ dS/S = r dt + \sigma(S,t)dB}
so that variance is a *deterministic* function of $S$ and $t$ over the life
of the option.  Such an asset will experience many different volatility
regimes during the evolution $s_t \rightarrow s_T$ to expiry.  These 
volatilities are referred to as *local volatility*, as they are different 
across local regions in $S, t$ space.  

Given a current value $s_t$ of the underlying, paths $s_t \rightarrow s_T$ 
that end in the money (and therefore contribute to the expectation determining 
the Black-Scholes price) are different for options with different strike 
$K$ and expiry $T$.  Therefore, they will experience different values of 
$\sigma(s,t)$.  The *implied volatility* of this option is the Black-Scholes
volatility which reflects this local volatility experience.  This is another
sense in which it maybe be intuitive for different options $c_t(K,T)$ to 
have different *implied volatility* - traders are trying to account for 
possible local volatility regimes price paths that end in the money are 
likely to experience.  It can be shown that the implied volatility $\Sigma(K,T)$ 
of the option with strike $K$ and expiry $T$ is *approximately* the average
local volatility experienced by price paths between $s_t$ and $K$, where 
the underlying expires in the money.

## Local Volatility from Implied Volatility

It is well known to traders that butterflies 
\eq{\mrt{Butterfly}(K_2) = c(K_1)-2c(K_2)+c(K_3)}
where $K_1<K_2<K_3$ are three evenly spaced strikes all at a particular
expiry $T$, give insight into the risk neutral distribution of the underlying 
$S_T$ at expiry.  The Breeden-Litzenberger formula formalises this idea
\eq{p(s_T=K,T)=exp(-r \tau) \ppwrt{c_t(K,T)}{K}}.
Critically, the left hand side $p(s_T=K,T)$ is the risk neutral probability
that the underlying $S_t$ expires at $S_T=K$.  This motivates using derivatives
of call prices in strike space $K$ to provide information about the underlying
dynamics of $S_t$.  This is the insight in Dupire (1994) and the well known
PDE he derives.

I find the derivation in Derman \& Miller (2016) the most intuitive, and following
it is insightful.  This is especially true for our look at stochastic volatility
models.  That said, I will just include the tldr here for brevity.  They specify
a very flexible local volatility process 
\eqa{ dS/S &= r dt + \sigma(s,t,\hdots) dB \nonumber \\
 &= r dt + \sigma(s,t,\varepsilon) dB
}
where $\varepsilon$ contains other variables in addition to $S$ and $t$ which
affect local volatility, possibly including other stochastic processes.  Starting
at the usual pricing equation
\eq{ c_t(K,T) = exp(-r\tau) \mb{E}\left[ (S_T-K)H(S_T-K) \right] }
where $\mb{E}$ is a risk neutral expectation over $S_T$ *and* any other stochastic
variables that may be in $\varepsilon$.  The objective here is to take the 
*total derivative* of $c_t(K,T)$ with respect to $T$ while keeping strike $K$  
constant.  This induces a $dT$ as well as a stochastic change $dS_T$.  At a later
date I will write notes on the derivation, but that this point it is enough to
state that we arrive at the Dupire PDE
\eq{ \pwrt{C}{T} |_K = -rK\pwrt{C}{K} |_T + \frac{1}{2} K^2 \ppwrt{C}{K}|_T 
\mb{E}\left[ \sigma(S,T,\varepsilon)\right]}
This PDE should be solved starting at expiry, so has *initial condition* 
$C=\mrt{max}(S_T-K,0)$.  The expectation is the diffusion coefficient 
which must be positive for the PDE to be meaningful.  It can be shown using
arbitrage arguments that this is indeed the case.  

How is the PDE useful?  Typically we rearrange
\eq{
    \frac{1}{2}\mb{E}\left[ \sigma(S,T,\varepsilon)\right] 
    = \frac{\pwrt{C}{T} |_K + rK\pwrt{C}{K} |_T}{K^2 \ppwrt{C}{K}|_T}
}
which is an incredibly useful representation, given that we can (essentially) read 
off all terms on the right hand side using observed market prices (we have to
deal with the problem that prices are only available at discrete points 
in $K$, $T$).  We know that prices and implied vols are interchangeable, so it
is an exercise in chain rule to derive a similar equation using observed implied 
volatility.
